# FLASH-CARDS

# Project-Goals/Objectives

- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

# The Project

- In this project the goal was to create a program that simulates a set of flash cards through the command line. A user will have the ability to see questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. To make this happen I have broken the project up into small classes to demonstrate object's single responsibility. 

# The Game/Set-Up

- step1. Open your terminal command + space

- step2. Go to the directory where the file excist. cd flash-cards

- step3. In order to run the game we need to put node index.js
